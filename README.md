# MarkMath
Repository of MarkMath for Hypatia

How to run the app?
Run the Login class to run the app. The password is set to "jordanpass" since you will be downloading our database, with already some sample classes, students and assignments. We thought this would be easier to test. If you had started with opening the app for the first time and an empty database, you would be asked to create an account with a new password.

What libraries are needed?
All the libraries that are needed can be found in the libraries folder inside the idea folder.

Want more information on each role of the class?
All files support javadoc. So, run javadoc to have all the html pages needed to describe in detail the role of each class or method.

How to test the program?
The Help feature in the program tells everything needed to work with the app. If you want to test the marking functionality, you can create an Assignment Template in Hypatia, create some checkmath expressions, give the file the name of the form "StudentID-NameOfAssignment" (ex: 22-Derivatives), and you will be able to mark it. These instructions are also in the program, just summarized here.
